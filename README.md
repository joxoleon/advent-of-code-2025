```

## Usage

1. Copy your puzzle input into the appropriate `input1.txt` or `input2.txt` file
2. Run the solution:

```bash
python3 days/day01/pt1.py  # Run Day 1 Part 1
python3 days/day01/pt2.py  # Run Day 1 Part 2
```

Each Python file loads its respective input file and provides the text line by line.
